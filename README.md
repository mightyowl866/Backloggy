# Backloggy
A simple database intended to manage your backlogged games.

Welcome! Thank you for using Backloggy! This is a very early build, so expect bugs
and or glitches, however I have done my best stamping them out.

Regardless, some Known Bugs:
Search does not work without System input. Works fine with the System input.

If you notice any bugs at any point in your time using the program, send me an email through the email form on owlbytes.ca through either the home page, or Contact page.


How do I use it?
================
Your database of games will be displayed in the console, following the format of

GAME: SYSTEM: STATUS:


To add a game to the database, enter in the name of the game you want to add.
Then, in the next box, select the system that you have it on through the dropdown menu.
After that, select the status of your game from the dropdown menu.

For example, your entry can look like:

	Sonic Heroes
	
	GCN

	Played

Once that it is all set up, hit the save button and congratulations! The entry is now in your
database!

If you want to remove the entry, just follow the same process as above.

To edit an entry, enter the name of the game you want to edit, and simply adjust them by
by their status/system.

To delete an entry, enter the details of the game in input boxes, and hit delete. This will
permanently remove the game from the database, and you will have to enter it again if you want
to add it back.

To search, do the same as you would when adding a game. At the moment you NEED the system input
for the search function work. I will try and fix this in the future.

Sort by name and Sort by System sort them alphabettically.

Finally, you can export this database to an excel spreadsheet. That file is exported to the folder that the program is located in.
